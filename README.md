### Cracking the Coding Interview (5th)

Solutions for Cracking [the Coding Interview 5th Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X) by [Gayle Laakmann McDowell](http://www.gayle.com/). I will add the 6th edition's solution to another repository.

The majority of this repository's solution wrote in Python. But `Chapter8: Object Oriented Design` and `Chapter14: Java` solutions wrote in Java. 

### Unsupported Chapters

* Chapter13: C anc C++ (will not support)
* Chapter17: Moderate (will add soon)
* Chapter18: Hard (will add soon)

### Note

I refereed [CareerCup's Solution](https://github.com/careercup/CtCI-6th-Edition) and [w-hat's Solutions](https://github.com/w-hat/ctci-solutions). These solutions are noteworthy.

/**
 * Q16_1
 * In the famous dining philosophers problem,
 * a bunch of philosophers are sitting around a circular table with one chopstick between each of them.
 * A philosopher needs both chopsticks to eat, and always picks up the left chopstick before the right one.
 * A deadlock could potentially occur if all the philosophers reached for the left chopstick at the same time.
 * Using threads and locks, implement a simulation of the dining philosophers problem that prevents deadlocks.
